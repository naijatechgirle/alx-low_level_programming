0x1C. C - Makefiles

Makefile sets a set of rules to determine which parts of a program need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them. • Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex tasks with dependencies. • Makefile contains: dependency rules, macros and suffix(or implicit) rules. The “make” program in Linux is used to compile and manage a set of source code applications and files. It allows developers to install and gather a range of apps via the terminal. It also controls and cuts down on the amount of time necessary for compilation. The basic objective of the make command is to break down a large program into smaller chunks and determine if it needs to be recompiled. It also has all of the necessary instructions for recompiling them.
